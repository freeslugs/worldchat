# World Chat - Telegram Messaging Bot

World Chat is an evolved version of XMTPizza, a Telegram bot that enables users to send and receive messages using both the XMTP and Push protocols. This project started as XMTPizza, a bot specifically designed to communicate with the XMTP team through XMTP messages. Over time, it evolved into World Chat, offering a broader feature set and capabilities to facilitate seamless messaging between users on various platforms.

## Features
- Send and receive messages using both XMTP and Push protocols.
- Interact with the XMTP team through the bot (formerly XMTPizza).
- Sign up and use the bot to request snack deliveries, like tic tacs (formerly XMTPizza feature).

## Getting Started
To get started with World Chat, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm install.
3. Obtain a Telegram API token and a Push API key. Set these tokens as environment variables in a .env file.
4. Set up a PostgreSQL database and provide the database URL as an environment variable in the .env file.
5. Run the bot using node index.js.
6. Ensure that your environment is set up correctly with the necessary API tokens and database credentials for the bot to function correctly.

## Usage
Once the bot is up and running, start a conversation with it on Telegram. World Chat will guide you on how to send and receive messages. You can interact with other users who are using the bot and communicate with them through both XMTP and Push protocols.

### XMTPizza 
The original version of the bot, XMTPizza, specifically communicated with the XMTP team through the XMTP protocol. It allowed nearly 40 participants during the hackathon to send messages to the team, including snack delivery requests like tic tacs. The XMTPizza feature remains active and functional within World Chat.
